open git shell and run the following commands where you want Phy installed

git clone https://github.com/kwikteam/phy
cd phy
conda env create -n phy
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/kwikteam/phy-contrib
cd phy
activate phy
python setup.py develop 
cd ../phy-contrib
python setup.py develop

Then run 

phy template-gui params.py (--debug, if you get an error)

where params.py is a text file that KiloSort should produce. In case of errors, check that params.py contains information like this:

dat_path = '20160330_ap_CAR.dat' % filename
n_channels_dat = 32 % number of channels 
dtype = 'int16'
offset = 0
sample_rate = 30000.
hp_filtered = False

If you get an error, you might not have some packages. You install these with "pip install package_name". Some of these  are 

pip install click
pip install tdqm (I think...)
